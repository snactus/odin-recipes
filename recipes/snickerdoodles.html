        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Ahhh... the taste of fall. There's nothing like the delicious taste of cinnamon sugar to ease you into the cold season. Their beautifully fragmented tops and slightly tangy yet sweet flavor lets you know that you can relax and enjoy your creation. </p>
      
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 3/4 Cups sugar</li>
            <li>1 Tablespoon cinnamon</li>
            <li>2 1/2 Cups flour</li>
            <li>2 Teaspoons cream of tartar</li>
            <li>1 Teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>1/2 Teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 Stick softened butter (unsalted)</li>
            <li>1/2 Cup vegetable shortening</li>
            <li>2 Large eggs</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <p>Preheat the oven to 375ยบ. Combine 1/4 cups of sugar and the cinnamon in a shallow dish and set aside. Whisk flour, cream of tartar, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl. In a seperate bowl, beat the butter, shortening, and remaining 1 1/2 cups of sugar together until light and fluffy, and then beat in eggs one by one until combined. Gradually mix in dry ingredients until fully combined, leaving no flour pockets. Roll a small ball of dough in the cinnamon sugar, and place on cookie sheet. Bake for 10-12 minutes. Let cool on baking sheet for a couple of minutes and then transfer to rack.</p>
