        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <h3>Part one</h3>
        <p>Begin preparation of this dish four days before you wish to eat it. Start by 
            removing the feet of your three chickens. Set them aside in a freezer. Leave
            one of the raw chickens out in a warm, humid place. Using a blender, combine 
            the other two chickens and the jug of detergent and blend into a thick puree. 
            Set your puree in the fridge or freezer.</p>
        <h3>Part two</h3>
        <p>Begin the second part of the preparation on the day you wish to eat the meal. 
            Begin by bringing a large pot of water to a roiling boil. Add the brown sugar 
            and stir until it dissolves. Add the jasmine rice to the thick sugary liquid. 
            In a second pot combine the high-fructose corn syrup and spices over heat. Add 
            your puree to this mixture and let it cook on low heat. let simmer while you cook. 
            Fill a third pot with the beef stock. Add the assorted vegetables. Add the cane 
            sugar. Add the bull semen. Add the chicken feet you prepared earlier. Let these boil. 
            Take the raw chicken you left on the counter and put it on a large platter. Put the
            soft pretzel on the top of the rotten chicken. The rice should have turned into a sort 
            of mush now. Pour the rice over the top of the chicken and pretzel. Then pour over your 
            sweet chicken puree. Then add your sweet veggie-beef-semen concoction to the top. Garnish
            with the chicken feet. Pour your cup of salt over the top of the dish and serve.</p>
